# University of Arizona Bootcamp Challenge 1

## Description 

Here you will find one of my very first complete uploads to GitHub. Where I am learning to develop and improve my skills of HTML and CSS. Some of these improvements will be listed in the "KEY LEARNING TOOLS" that will be referenced below. Now, bear with me as this is not only going to be my first HTML or CSS improvement to already written code, but also my first README.md files that I have put thought into. This leads me into some of the difficulties that I had in this first project. One of the biggest was understanding the terminology of things that even after just a couple days of application seem so juvenile and simple, things such as semantic elements, or organizational structure of an HTML document. 

My first stab at this was sitting at the computer and staring at the instructions for nearly 30 minutes trying to understand what to truly do. After realizing how laid out and simple it really was the actual implication of these tasks went better than I thought they would. They are not perfect by any means, and I am sure there are areas that I have easily missed, but this project is published in the hopes that someday I can come back and look at where I started when I am down on myself for not figuring something out. Looking back will allow me the perspective to determine that I can succeed and that if this is where I started from compared to where I will be in the future, I can accomplish any task with enough critical thinking. 

Most of the adjustments that I made happened to be in the HTML document, but there was still a good amount of consolidation that was done on the CSS document. These additions on the CSS document were not to adjust the styling of the page since it was already styled in the way it was intended, but to reduce the amount of required code. To make the document smaller in hopes that one day if there was needed additions, they would not hinder the running of the page due to unnecessary lines. Some of the challenges that I faced I have already stated such as the terminology or the CSS consolidation, and these struggles being on my own is what will set me on the correct career path of becoming a developer! 

## KEY LEARNING TOOLS 

What are semantic elements? 

This to me was the biggest question when starting and I will do my very best at explaining this concept back to everyone else. When you look at an HTML that does not have semantic elements you will see plenty of 'div' or 'span', but do not get confused, when you see this that does not mean the HTML is written incorrectly. What semantic elements aim for that are lacking in those two elements is description, the description of a 'div' does not mean that much, while if you gave it a 'header' tag, this tells the HTML and other developers who may work on your project that "here is the header". There are plenty of semantic tags and adding them into your HTML is a great habit that you should develop. 

Acceptance Criteria 

While creating this nice smooth code is great, wasn’t there something else that was asked of us? 

Of course! The acceptance criteria are there so that the code we create can be, that’s right, accepted. One thing the criteria also asked us for was to meet the accessibility standards, the way this was done was to look at each img and add an 'alt' tag, so that there was screen reader for the disabled. This allowed anyone who is blind to be able to understand what is showing on the site. Other criteria not touched on yet was that the title had to be added so that it was to the point but still detailed. I did this by added the name of the company and a short description of them 'Digital Marketing'.
